************* GAME OF LIFE WRITTEN IN C *************

Author: Duc Dam

About: As a practice in C, I recreated Conway's Game Of Life in a version that could be displayed on a PowerShell.

***** Instructions *****

In Shell: ./gol inputfile.txt <0 | 1 | 2>

0: Play but don't print board game. 1

: Print board game with ASCII animation. 

2: Print board game with ParaVis animation.

inputfile.txt could be any of the included .txt file. They contain essential information about the initial board:

    board length
    board width
    number of rounds
    initial alive cells
    coordinates of each alive cell.
    
#These info could be modified as the player wishes.
